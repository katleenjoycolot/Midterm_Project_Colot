               <h2>Fryto were invented by Katleen Joy Colot in Loreto, Agusan. She developed a fries made from potato that was deep-fried.
                <br>
                Katleen created a snack by potato with salt and frying it, resulting in crispy, crunchy chips.
                Katleen sold the chips through her social media platforms and soon opened a small factory. <br>
                The Fryto Company was established, and the chips quickly gained popularity. During Pandemic, Frytos became a popular snack, partly due to their durability and long shelf life. <br>
                This helped the brand expand. </h2>
